# Agent Inbox

> Let local AI agents such as Claude Code and Codex receive tasks and reply with results directly inside Discord, Feishu, and other IM platforms, without any server. Everything runs on your own machine.

## Why Agent Inbox

- **Inbox-first workflow** - Send a message to the bot in your IM app, let the agent open a session automatically, execute the task, and send the result back with file upload and download support.
- **Multiple IM platforms** - Discord and Feishu are supported today, and the architecture is designed to extend cleanly to additional platforms.
- **Multiple agent backends** - Switch between Claude Code and OpenAI Codex depending on the task.
- **Runs locally with full data control** - Configuration and runtime state live in `~/.agent-inbox/`, with no cloud deployment required.
- **Persistent sessions** - Keep context across messages, interrupt and resume work, and isolate each session in its own working directory.

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Install

```bash
npm install -g @doctorwu/agent-inbox
# Or run it directly without a global install
npx @doctorwu/agent-inbox
```

### Step 2: Configure

On first launch, Agent Inbox starts an interactive setup wizard that walks you through the IM platform and agent backend configuration.

Configuration is stored in `~/.agent-inbox/config.jsonl`. Example:

```jsonc
{"type":"meta","version":1}
{"type":"im","id":"discord","enabled":true,"config":{"token":"your-bot-token","clientId":"your-client-id"}}
{"type":"im","id":"feishu","enabled":false,"config":{"appId":"","appSecret":""}}
{"type":"runtime","config":{"agentTimeoutMs":600000}}
```

### Step 3: Start

```bash
agent-inbox
```

After startup, send a message to your configured bot to begin interacting with the agent.

## Supported IM Platforms

| Platform | Status | Notes |
|------|------|------|
| **Discord** ⭐ Recommended | ✅ Supported | Slash commands + thread sessions, file upload/download support, streaming output |
| **Feishu (Lark)** | ✅ Supported | Long-connection mode, DM-triggered session groups, interrupt cards on every message |

### Discord Setup

Create a bot in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and obtain its `Token` and `Client ID`.

Discord is the recommended platform for the best interactive workflow. It supports:

- `/code <prompt>` — Start a coding task and automatically create a dedicated thread for the session
- `/ask <question>` — Ask a quick question without file tools
- `/skill <name> <prompt>` — Invoke a predefined skill directly
- `/model <name>` — Switch the active agent model
- `/effort <level>` — Set the agent effort level
- `/interrupt` — Interrupt the current task
- `/done` — End the current session
- `@mention` — Mention the bot in a channel to trigger a conversation there as well

### Feishu Setup

Create a self-built enterprise application in the [Feishu Open Platform](https://open.feishu.cn), enable long-connection event subscriptions, and obtain the `App ID` and `App Secret`.

For safety, you can restrict code-mode (tool-enabled) execution to specific Feishu users by setting an allowlist of `open_id` values via `authorizedOpenIds` in the Feishu config record (or `FEISHU_AUTHORIZED_OPEN_IDS` when running from `.env`).

---

## Supported Agent Backends

| Backend | Notes |
|---------|------|
| **Claude Code** | Anthropic Claude with streaming output and tool calling |
| **OpenAI Codex** | OpenAI Codex CLI with streaming output |

You can switch the backend for the current session through the setup wizard or IM commands.

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Build all packages
pnpm build

# Start after building
pnpm start

# Development mode (run adapters independently)
pnpm dev:discord
pnpm dev:feishu
```

Use the repo root `.env` file for local environment variables during development. See `.env.example` for reference.

### Build Outputs
